How to contribute
==================
We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

- Fork the project
- Make one or more well commented and clean commits to your repository. It's better to create new branch for this purpose.
- Submit a pull request from github's web interface.
- Don't forget to spread the word about how cool you and PySubD are!

Syntax:
Stick to PEP8.

It would be great if you could add some tests for your changes.

Always rebase your branch on top of the branch of the current master of the original repo. This is important so that your pull request
results in a fast-forward merge.
